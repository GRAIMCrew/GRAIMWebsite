					<div class="title">NOW AND THEN</div>
					<div class="container">
						<p class="style4">The school of Computer Music of the <a href="http://www.consvi.it">Conservatory “A. Pedrollo”</a> in Vicenza has existed since 2003/04. It was born in the classrooms of the so-called <i>GRAIM</i> (Musical Acoustics and Informatics Research Group), an Electronic Music laboratory founded at the Conservatory a few years earlier with the aim of carrying out research and production.
                            With the opening of an Electronic Music chair in 2003/04, lessons began held by Lorenzo Pagliei, founding teacher of the course.<br>
                            At the beginning, <i>GRAIM</i> consisted of a single class attended by only four students. After 20 years of activity it is a university course, organized as an independent department, with 4 chairs, 3-4 external contract professors and attended by 48 students. The roll of honor includes 6 diplomas from the old system, 40 first level degrees, 3 second level degrees and 7 thesis holders. The current number of students enrolled is greater than the sum of all the students of the other Electronic Music courses in the region.</p>

					<div class="title">TEACHING CREATIVITY</div>
					<div class="container">
						<p class="style4">At <i>GRAIM</i> the teachers pursue a teaching of creativity which, after providing the theoretical and practical foundations, puts the student in a realistic professional situation in which he must find a perfectly functioning solution for the required creative and technical purposes by his work or by a client. Nothing needs to be "user-proof" like technological and multimedia applications, be it a professional musician, ephemeral user, spectator or buyer.<br>
							A particular and delicate work is carried out on ideas (musical, interactive, installation, video, algorithmic), from the initial inspiration, through the organic development of its consequences, up to the final realization. The tutoring of creativity involves fundamental listening to the student, the reasons for his inspiration, his path, how he carries out his creative work by tackling the issues and the problems that the creation of a work entails.
