									<h3 class="icon solid fa-cog"> ENTRY REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
									<p>
										High school diploma or another qualification obtained abroad and recognized as suitable (required upon enrolment). <br>
										In the case of particularly strong artistic qualities, the candidate may be admitted even if he does not have a high school diploma which, however, must be obtained before taking the final test.<br>
										Admission is subject to passing the selection test which verifies knowledge in the field of electronic and electroacoustic music and basic scientific and technical knowledge.
										After enrolment, the student will take a test of knowledge and skills of basic musical education in the following areas:<br><ul>
										<li>Use of musical notation, knowledge of the fundamental elements of music theory and exercise of the fundamental skills relating to listening and rhythmic and sung reading.</li></ul></p>
                                        <h3 class="icon solid fa-cog"> EDUCATIONAL GOALS:</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            At the end of the studies relating to the bachelor's degree in Electronic Music, students must have acquired specific technical and cultural skills such as to allow them to concretely realize their own
											artistic idea. <br>To this end, particular emphasis will be given to the study of the historical and contemporary electroacoustic musical repertoire and to the in-depth analysis of its own analytical methodologies, including the history of electroacoustic technologies
											and computer science applied to music. These objectives must also be achieved by encouraging the development of perceptive hearing and memorization skills, in particular in the context of the sound materials typical of the electroacoustic musical repertoire. 
											<br>At the end of the three-year period, students must have acquired in-depth knowledge of the general stylistic, historical and aesthetic aspects relating to the specific field. Furthermore, with reference to the specificity of the course, the student must possess adequate
											skills concerning the use of electroacoustic and IT instruments as well as design skills relating to installations dedicated to the performance of the specific repertoire. The training objective of the course is also the acquisition of adequate skills
											relating to a second community language.</p>
                                        <h3 class="icon solid fa-cog"> CARREER OUTCOMES:</h3>
